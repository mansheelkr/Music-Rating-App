# Tune Vibes
A command-line based music-sharing and rating application which allows two types of users, artists and listeners, to interact. It simulates the core functionality of a music platform by allowing content creation, exploration, and feedback.
Artists can create and manage albums (collections of songs grouped under a common title). Each song has a title, genre, and rating to be indexed more easily. Albums form the artist's music catalog, a personal archive of all of their uploaded content. Artists can edit or delete content from this catalog and receive feedback through numeric song ratings submitted by listeners.
Listeners can browse or search the platform's entire music library, rate songs on a 1-10 scale, and create playlists (user-customized collections of songs based on preferences).
